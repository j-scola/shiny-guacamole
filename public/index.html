      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Frontend Engineer with experience in creating enterprise-level
        features for banking software, as well as designing innovative solutions
        in startups. Passionate about front-end development, I excel in using
        modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.

        <h3>Frontend Software Engineer</h3>
        <h4>2020 - present</h4>
        <p>
          I have over four years of profession experience as a Frontend Software
          Engineer. The bulk of my experience has been working on a UX Team for
          a Credit Union online banking product. My notable achievement in this
          field are a brand new International ACH Payment Feature, standardizing
          payment frequency tooling into a standardized reusable component, and
          significantly increasing project automated test coverage.
        </p>
        <h3>Hack Reactor</h3>
        <h4>2020</h4>
        <p>
          In 2020, my interest in programming let me to transition from my
          Product Management career track to pursue a career as a software
          engineer. I attended the Hack Reactor SF Software Engineering
          Immersive program, a 17-week, nearly 1000-hour intensive course. This
          program introduced me to core principles of software development, best
          practices of modern web development, and exposure to popular web
          development frameworks.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Management</h3>
        <h4>2018 - 2020</h4>
        <p>
          My career in software development began as a product manager. At a
          digital ad agency specializing in mobile growth marketing, I led a
          team of engineers in delivering features to account managers and
          clients. My goal in the tools I designed and worked to deliver was to
          simplify and automate the process of initiating, monitoring and
          optimizing an ad campaign. The bid mediation interface we built
          reduced time-to-launch by 30%.
